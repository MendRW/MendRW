Hi, I'm Rory.
I'm looking for every opportunity to learn and build skills to accumulate experience in software development.
My goal is to acquire the necessary skills to create, improve and deconstruct software.
I am currently learning Python via Freecodecamp as a starting point. I then plan on moving to JS.
